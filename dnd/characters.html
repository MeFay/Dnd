                    You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard).<br>
                    You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.<br>
                    Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game,<br>

                <p class="body"> Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession, it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. 
                Your class gives you a variety of special features, <br>such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells.

    <p class="body">A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.

                    Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.</p>
